# A short guide to TibiaScape

[Tibiascape website](https://tibiascape.com/) | [Tibiascape wiki](https://tibiascape.wiki/Main_Page)

I created this short guide to write down what I learn about the game. If you have suggestions for improvement, please submit and issue or a pull request.

# Runes

In Tibiascape runes cannot be created by using mana and casting spells. Instead, they can be:
- Looted from monsters - mostly from evil or demonic ones
- Bought from the market
- Crafted by players

Crafted runes always have 1 more charge than regular, e.g. a crafted UH will have at minimum 2 charges. The higher the crafting skill level, the higher the chance to get additional charges.

For example, around crafting level 30 you'll start noticing 3x UH runes, at crafting level 60 you'll notice 4x UH runes etc. The max crafting level is 100.

## Rune crafting

To craft a rune you need a blank rune matching its color. To obtain the blank rune, you need 5 fragments of the same color. Fragments can be obtained from the market or by mining. If you have at least 5 fragments in your backpack, open _Crafting_ menu, select _Runecrafting_ and choose which blank rune you'd like to craft.

# Mining

Mining can currently only be done in a special area in Kazordoon. To visit it:
- Go to Kazordoon depot
- Talk to Lokur and purchase a "ticket"
- Use the second wagon from the right in the depot

You'll be teleported to the mining area.

To mine, you need to craft mining pickaxes. Open the _Crafting_ dialog in the client (next to _Bestiary_), choose _Tools_ and craft a _Stone Pickaxe_. You can now head into any direction - east, west, north, south. You mine by having a mining pickaxe in your hand and right clicking on the walls or ores you find along the way.

The higher the mining skill, the more damage you can deal with your pickaxe. The mining skill can be increased by wearing equipment which boots it, which can be purchased from [Item Bazaar](https://tibiascape.com/bazaar/items) or from players, You can also purchase a mining boosts from the Shop (the _Shop_ button with green text below logout in the client).

## Bestiary

You gain experience points for killing a specific number of monsters. For first 100 kills you'll be rewarded with experience equivalent to 100 of those mobs, e.g. for killing 100 dragons you'll receive 70 000 experience.

With each next bestiary milestone, you receive less experience per monster:

- 100 kills - 100% experience
- 400 kills - 90% experience
- 500 kills - 80% experience
- 1500 kills - 70% experience
- 2500 kills - 60% experience

## Death

When you die, your experience and skill gain will be doubled until you've regained the same level of experience and skills. For example killing a dragon you'll gain double the exprience you normally would - 1400 exp.

Experience and skill loss:

    No blessings and no promotion: 10%
    No blessings and promotion: 7%

Each purchased blessing decreases your losses by 1%.

**NOTE: Bestiary and death:** Your experience gain is double only until you regain the same level of experience - it doesn't matter how you do it. If you complete a bestiary milestone while on double experience, and through that regain the same level of experience you had before dying, you'll lose the double experience bonus. It's therefore advisable to avoid completing a bestiary milestone while you're on double experience - you'll be able to gain more experience in the same time.
