# A short guide to TibiaScape

[Tibiascape website](https://tibiascape.com/) | [Tibiascape wiki](https://tibiascape.wiki/Main_Page)

I created this short guide to write down what I learn about the game. If you have suggestions for improvement, please submit an issue or a pull request.

## Character stats

In Tibiascape every time you advance a level you're rewarded with 10 mastery points which you can spend to increase any of the attributes: health points (hp), mana points (mp), health regeneration, mana regeneration, speed, and capacity. 

Depending on your vocation and whether you have promotion or not, each point spent will increase you character stat by a different number. For example, spending 1 mastery point on hp as a knight you'd receive 3 hp, but as a mage only 1 hp. This system allows you to fully customize your character.

### Statues

All over the map you can find mastery statues. Finding and using each statue grants you 1 additional mastery point. There are over 400 mastery statues across the continents - some hidden in places players don't typically visit, others in quest areas, still others placed in what seems random locations. 

## Rarity system

One of the most exciting features in Tibiascape is the possibility of looting and creating items with special attributes. Every monster has a chance to drop an item which will show as _unidentified_. You'll notice when this happend if after killing a monster you'll _Rarity!_ text appear over its body. When you _use_ an unidentified item, it'll become of the following:

| Rarity     | Color  | Attributes              |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------------------- |
| Common     | Green  | 1 additional attribute  |
| Rare       | Blue   | 2 additional attributes |
| Epic       | Purple | 3 additional attributes |
| Legendary  | Orange | 4 additional attributes |
| Ancient    | Red    | 5 additional attributes |
| Mythic     | Brown  | 6 additional attributes |

### Attributes 
The additional attributes can be added as "locked" or "open":
- Locked - This attribute cannot be removed from the item unless the item is reforged (see below)
- Open - This attribute can be added and removed unlimited number of times:
    - Using a _Rarity Ore_ on the item will add a random attribute to an _Open_ attribute slot
    - Using a _Nullify Ore_ on the item will remove a random non-locked attribute from the item

We can use _Mystic Ores_ on an item with a rarity to get a chance to affect its attributes. When using the ore on an item, any of its attributes can be increased, decreased, or renaub unaffected.

The stronger the monster which dropped the item, the higher the values of additional attributes can be. Additionally, once an item has been identified, it's possible to increase it's level. Max level of an item achieved thus far is 7 (seven). Baseline level is 0 (zero). We get the chance to increase or decrease item level by using a _Cursed Ore_ on any item with rarirty. It's best to first increase the level of an item before starting to use mystic ores on it.

It's also possible to turn a regular item into one with rarity using a _Magic Ore_ on an item (dropped by evil and demonic monsters). This will turn your item into an unidentified one.

For special items which received bad additional attribute(s) it's also possible to turn them back into unidentified. This can be done in _The Forge_ in the _Depot Hub_ which provides a 50% chance of reforging an item or losing a hefty sum of money or an exalted core. Each item can be reforged a limited number of times.

## Quests 

Most quests in Tibiascape have altered rewards. Instead of getting equipment you'll instead receive ores, runes, rings of healing and other items. 

Besides the quests, you can also fight in the Svargrond arenas: Greenhorn, Scrapper, and Warlord. The rewards offer a choice of items useful for every profession. 

## Guilds

A guild can level up. Guild levels are increased by donating ores to the guild. Every level additional 5 more guild seats are unlocked. Every 2 levels a new perk is available to choose from. Here are the known perks:

| Level | Option 1                | Option 2             |
| ----- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| 2     | +2 hp regen             | +1 mana regen        |
| 4     | +5% dmg to monsters     | +5% dmg to players   |
| 6     | +1 magic level          | +5 all skills        |
| 8     | +3% physical resistance | +3% magic resistance |
| 10    | +3% critical chance     | +20% critical damage |


## Runes

In Tibiascape runes cannot be created by using mana and casting spells. Instead, they can be:
- Looted from monsters - mostly from evil or demonic ones
- Bought from the market - although limited to 1x runes
- Crafted by players - most common and profitable

Crafted runes always have 1 more charge than regular, e.g. a crafted UH will have at minimum 2 charges. The higher the crafting skill level, the higher the chance to get additional charges.

For example, around crafting level 30 you'll start noticing 3x UH runes, at crafting level 60 you'll notice 4x UH runes etc. The max crafting level is 100.

## Rune crafting

To craft a rune you need a blank rune matching its color. To obtain the blank rune, you need 5 fragments of the same color. Fragments can be obtained from the market or by mining. If you have at least 5 fragments in your backpack, open _Crafting_ menu, select _Runecrafting_ and choose which blank rune you'd like to craft.

## Mining

Mining can currently only be done in a special area in Kazordoon. To visit it:
- Go to Kazordoon depot
- Talk to Lokur and purchase a "ticket"
- Use one of the wagons to travel to area. The wagon will be marked with a pickaxe next to it

You'll be teleported to the mining area.

To mine, you need to craft mining pickaxes. Open the _Crafting_ dialog in the client (next to _Bestiary_), choose _Tools_ and craft a _Stone Pickaxe_. You can now head into any direction from the spot where you originally arrived - east, west, north, south. You mine by having a mining pickaxe in your hand and right clicking on the walls or ores you find along the way.

The higher the mining skill, the more damage you can deal with your pickaxe. The mining skill can be increased by wearing equipment which boots it, which can be purchased from [Item Bazaar](https://tibiascape.com/bazaar/items) or from players, You can also purchase a mining boosts from the Shop (the _Shop_ button with green text below logout in the client).

## Skinning

Creature items like dragon leather can be obtained by skinning animals using an obsidian knife, or a blessed wooden stake. Obsidian knives can be crafted, but have a chance to break when during use. 

## Bestiary

You gain experience points for killing a specific number of monsters. For first 100 kills you'll be rewarded with experience equivalent to 100 of those mobs, e.g. for killing 100 dragons you'll receive 70 000 experience.

With each next bestiary milestone, you receive less experience per monster:

- 100 kills - 100% experience
- 400 kills - 90% experience
- 500 kills - 75% experience
- 1500 kills - 60% experience
- 2500 kills - 50% experience

## Death

When you die, your experience and skill gain will be doubled until you've regained the same level of experience and skills. For example killing a dragon you'll gain double the exprience you normally would - 1400 exp.

Experience and skill loss:
- No blessings and no promotion: 10%
- No blessings and promotion: 7%

Each purchased blessing decreases your losses by 1%.

**NOTE: Bestiary and death:** Your experience gain is double only until you regain the same level of experience - it doesn't matter how you do it. If you complete a bestiary milestone while on double experience, and through that regain the same level of experience you had before dying, you'll lose the double experience bonus. It's therefore advisable to avoid completing a bestiary milestone while you're on double experience - you'll be able to gain more experience in the same time.

# Monster classes (races)

Tibiascape has its own system of categorizing monsters. These differ from Tibia. To be able to wisely choose a character stat which increase your resitance or damage to a particular group, it's good to know which monster falls under which category. For brevity here's my subjective categorization of which groups of items are best to pick and when are they useful based on the number of monsters in each category and how likely one would be hunting them.

**Great:**
- Demons
- Dragons
- Humans
- Magicals
- Undeads
  
**Good:**
- Giants
- Vermin
- Lycanthropes
  
**Okay:**
- Aquatics
- Reptiles
- Humanoid

**Poor:**
- Amphibics
- Constructs
- Dimensionals
- Elemental
- Slimes

**Bad:**
- Mammals
- Birds
- Feys
- Plants

If there's interest, I could list all monsters which belong to each category.

## Dungeons
